				<h1> Parts of a Wedding </h1>
				<p>
				Do you know the parts of a wedding? Most people think a wedding is just the ceremony, but it has a lot of different things that happen in just one day! This would be a small summary of the most important parts:
				</p>
				<ul class="parts-wedding">
				  <li>The Ceremony: when they get married!</li>
				  <li>The Cocktail: where they meet thei guests and have nice drinks</li>
				  <li>Lunch: eating is a really important part, they have to charge batteries for later!</li>
				  <li>The Party: everything starts with the first dance, really romantic!</li>
				</ul>

				<h1> Wedding altar </h1>
				<p>
				This is one of the most important places of the day. Is where the ceremony is going to be, and everyone will be looking at it! They get personalized for every couple, so they can say something about them! Is very common to use a wood structure and decorate it with flowers, in that way they can get a natural effect!

				<h1> Wedding dress and suit </h1>
				<p>
				Theses are used to be one of the most important things for the couple when thinking about their wedding, and they are right! You have to think that they will be wearing those suits all day long, so they have to be comfortable. But, remember, each person has a different taste, and that would be 100% reflected in their suit choice!
