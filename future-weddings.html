				<h1> Winter Wedding </h1>
				<p>
				As long as I have worked, most of the weddings where near summer, except one that was in December, although we had really good time for the date it was. But, by far, a wedding I am willing to plan is one under the snow. I have always liked the snow and it will be a very different place for celebrating it. Will Lithuania be the place where it happens? 
Thought I want to organize it, we need to be clear, it has a lot of risks because of the weather, but, if there’s any couple interested in this type of weather, contact me! I would be pleased to think about creative ways in which we could make it work.

			<h1> Beach Wedding </h1>
				<p>
				In contrast to the winter wedding, it would be great to celebrate a beach wedding. The beach is relaxing for me and I think that with good organization, the sand won’t be a problem! These weddings are very common in places near the beach, we have beaches in the Basque Country, but not like the ones where these weddings are organized. The beaches we have near have more wind and in summer they are full of people, so it would be a problem. But I am looking forward to organizing a wedding outside of my region, so it will be on the beach!
