				<h1> 4th June. Sonsoles & Bruno </h1>
				<p>
				This was my first ever wedding as part of the staff and it was a really good start. 
				At a wedding, there are a lot of companies that take part in everything looking and happening perfectly as planned. This couple just asked for "Coordination". This service is based on coordinating all the companies, like photographers, the food, the videographers… so everyone does what they have to the day of the wedding. It’s one of the most important services!

				<h1> 9th July. Garaipen & Iñaki </h1>
				<p>
				My second wedding working. This wedding was very special because it had so many things for the guests, and for the couple. They got married in a beautiful country house in the Basque Country, on a really sunny day, where guests could play games, search for their seat through a funny game, had a really good lunch with lots of presents, and finished with a really good party where everyone had lots of fun, even us!

				<h1> 3rd September. Janire & Alain </h1>
				<p>
				This was our first wedding in September and the one whose weather put us in a risk. The morning of the wedding it was really cloudy and we needed to decide where to celebrate the ceremony, outside with the incredible views that the place offered, or inside, sheltered for the rain. Finally, we decided to celebrate the ceremony outside, and it was the best decision we could have taken, the sun shined the whole ceremony!
