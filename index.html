				<h1> Wedding Planning. Why? </h1>
				<p>
				I started as an internship and now it has became my job: Wedding Planning. I study Advertising and Public Relations degree, and the part I like more is the one about organizing events. You can organize an event and make people freak out about the new and original ideas you can implement, and at the same time, you can see them having a good time, the best part for me.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Why weddings? </b>
				</p>
				<p>
				I have always liked wedding dresses, so I started watching shows about people shopping for their dresses. This hobby continued developing and as I started my university degree I fell in love with all the parts that have something related to the moment in which 2 people get married. So, coming from my love for wedding dresses I decided I wanted to do an internship, and I had clear what job I wanted to do.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>My experience in Tipi Weddings.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
				</p>
				I think it was the best choice I could have made when choosing the company where I was going to work for the continuing 5 months. I had a great tutor that taught me everything about this job, and that help me fell in love with it. And luckily, nowadays this is my current workplace, and I couldn’t be happier!
